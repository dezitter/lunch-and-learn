# NOTES

## Applications

## Defining random

A *uniform* distribution is one where each possible number
is equally propable.

Number from 0 to 9 have a 1/10 chance of occurin in a
sequence, **on average**.

Any sequence of a 1M digits is as probably as any other, and
if trhe first 999 999 are `0`, the final digit has 1/10 chance
 to be 0.

## Early days

The production of random numbers using arithmetic operations
was first suggested by Johhn von Neumnann in 1946 with the "middle square method".

## PRNG

The sequence generated by a PRNG is not random, but it *appears* to be.

### LCG

- `m` the modulus with `0 < m`
- `a` the multiplier with `0 <= a < m`
- `c` the increment with `0 <= c < m`
- `X0` the starting value with `0 <= X0 < m`

Then `Xn+1 = (a * Xn + c) % m`.

Congruential sequences have a **cycle** of numbers that is repeated endlessly. The length of this cycle is called the **period**. The period is determined by `m`.

If multiplier equals 1 it's a bad choice since it yields
`Xn = (X0 + cn) % m`.

Because the period is determined by `m`, we want `m` to be large.

#### Choosing good LCG parameters

A big cycle does not guarantee randomness but is important
We want to maximize the period length which is at most `m`.

- `m` shall be large (determines the _maximum_ period)
- `m` shall favour speed of generation
- `m` is typically the word size of the computer such as `2^32`

- `a=1` is bad becauses it doesnt yield a random sequence
- Maximum period is achieved when `b = a-1` is a multiple of
each prime dividing `m`

##  Statistical tests

Statistics provides us with quantitative measures of randomness

If a sequence T1, T2, ..., Tn is random, we cannot be sure
it will not fail at Tn+1

Why do we need randomness

- security
- simulation with unknown variables
- games



- how does a PRNG work?
- whats a seed? how does it work?
- is there such as thing as a bad seed?
- how do you evaluate the quality of a PRNG?
- in LCG how do you choose multiplier, modulo, ...

                return state / mod;
